# Lab06 - messaging

## Technical Problems Encountered

During the completion of the tutorial, no technical problems were encountered. The tutorial was straightforward and the implementation of the messaging system was done without any issues.
The only slight usability drawback was with tweaking the run configuration of IntelliJ IDEA to run multiple instances of consumers concurrently, but this was resolved with the help of the IDE's documentation.

## Link to Code

You can find the code in a different repository [here](https://github.com/VojtechLunak/dat250-messaging).

## Pending Issues

No pending issues are present with this assignment. The tutorial was completed successfully and the messaging system works as expected.
